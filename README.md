# 📘 AI Study Productivity Analyzer

An AI-powered web application that analyzes students’ study habits and predicts productivity using machine learning and behavioral analytics. The system provides actionable insights through an interactive dashboard to help users improve focus, consistency, and overall academic performance.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Many students study for long hours but still struggle with low productivity due to poor focus, ineffective break patterns, distractions, and inconsistent study timings. There is no simple tool that helps students measure, understand, and improve their study productivity using data-driven insights.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

The **AI Study Productivity Analyzer** collects study behavior inputs (study time, breaks, focus, distractions, and study hour) and uses a trained machine learning model to predict a **productivity score (0–100)**.

The system visualizes productivity trends, identifies the most productive study hours, and provides weekly insights through a clean, modern dashboard.

## ✨ Key Features

- 📊 Productivity prediction using Machine Learning  
- ⏰ Time-based intelligence (hour of study & weekday patterns)  
- 📈 Interactive dashboard with charts and KPIs  
- 🧠 Smart insights (best study time, productivity health)  
- 📅 Weekly performance summary  
- 💾 Persistent data storage (CSV-based logging)  
- 🎨 Modern SaaS-style UI (Tailwind CSS)  

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- **Model Used:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **Why Random Forest?**
  - Handles non-linear patterns effectively
  - Performs well on small datasets
  - Captures complex interactions between behavioral features  

### Input Features
- Study minutes  
- Break minutes  
- Focus level (1–5)  
- Number of distractions  
- Hour of study  
- Day of week  

### Output
- Predicted productivity score (0–100)
